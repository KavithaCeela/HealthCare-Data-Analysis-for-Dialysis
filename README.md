# Healthcare Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing healthcare data, specifically data related to dialysis centers. The project uses real-world data to explore various key performance indicators (KPIs) and provide insights into the factors that contribute to the success of dialysis centers.

## Project Objectives
- Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) for dialysis centers.
- Analyze data related to these KPIs to understand trends and patterns.
- Develop data visualizations and dashboards to effectively communicate insights.
- Identify areas for improvement and potential strategies to enhance patient care.

## Data Sources
- The data used in this project is publicly available from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Care Compare website.
- The dataset includes information about dialysis facilities, patients, and various clinical and operational measures.

## Data Analysis Tools
- Excel
- Tableau
- Power BI

## Project Structure
- **Presentation**: Contains the main presentation slides summarizing the project findings.
- **Excel Dashboard**: An Excel spreadsheet with various data visualizations and calculations.
- **Tableau Dashboard**: A Tableau dashboard that provides interactive insights into the data.
- **Power BI Dashboard**: A Power BI dashboard that complements the Tableau dashboard with additional visualizations.

## Key Findings
- The project identified several key factors contributing to the success of dialysis centers, including proper management, staff qualification, patient care, and patient experience.
- Key performance indicators were analyzed, such as patient volume, profitability, chain organization, and payment reduction rates.
- The analysis revealed variations in performance across different facilities and regions, highlighting areas for improvement.

## Future Work
- Further exploration of factors influencing patient outcomes and satisfaction.
